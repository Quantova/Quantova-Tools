A comprehensive, open-source toolkit for implementing, testing, and benchmarking post-quantum cryptographic algorithms in Rust. This project provides practical examples and implementations of NIST-standardized and alternative post-quantum cryptographic primitives to help developers prepare systems for the quantum computing era.

## üìå Purpose & Overview

This toolkit serves as both an educational resource and a practical implementation guide for quantum-resistant cryptography. As quantum computers continue to advance, traditional cryptographic algorithms based on integer factorization (RSA) and discrete logarithm problems (ECC) will become vulnerable. This project demonstrates how to:

- Implement and use post-quantum cryptographic algorithms in Rust applications
- Compare performance characteristics across different algorithms
- Integrate quantum-resistant cryptography into existing systems
- Provide ready-to-use examples for blockchain and distributed systems

Our focus is on production-ready implementations with thorough documentation to facilitate adoption of quantum-resistant cryptography in real-world applications.

## üîç Why Post-Quantum Cryptography?

Quantum computers pose a significant threat to current cryptographic standards:

- Shor's algorithm can efficiently break RSA, DSA, ECC, and other public-key systems
- Grover's algorithm reduces the security of symmetric cryptography by roughly half
- Critical infrastructures like blockchain networks, financial systems, and secure communications require quantum resistance

This toolkit helps developers prepare for this cryptographic transition by implementing algorithms specifically designed to resist quantum attacks.

### ‚ö° ML-KEM (Kyber) - Key Encapsulation

```rust
use pqcrypto_kyber::kyber768::{keypair, encapsulate, decapsulate};
use pqcrypto_traits::kem::{PublicKey, SecretKey, SharedSecret};

// Generate keypair
let (public_key, secret_key) = keypair();

// Encapsulate - creates a shared secret and ciphertext
let (shared_secret_a, ciphertext) = encapsulate(&public_key);

// Decapsulate - recover the shared secret from ciphertext using secret key
let shared_secret_b = decapsulate(&ciphertext, &secret_key);

// Verify both parties have the same shared secret
assert_eq!(shared_secret_a.as_bytes(), shared_secret_b.as_bytes());
```

ML-KEM (Kyber) is a lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism standardized by NIST in 2023. It offers:

Key sizes and performance metrics are documented in the [Kyber Example](./examples/kyber_example.rs).

### üîè ML-DSA (Dilithium) - Digital Signatures

```rust
use pqcrypto_dilithium::dilithium3::{keypair, sign, verify, public_key_bytes, secret_key_bytes};
use pqcrypto_traits::sign::{PublicKey, SecretKey, DetachedSignature};

// Generate keypair
let (public_key, secret_key) = keypair();

// Message to sign
let message = b"This message will be signed with a quantum-resistant algorithm";

// Create signature
let signature = sign(message, &secret_key);

// Verify signature
let verified = verify(message, &signature, &public_key);
assert!(verified.is_ok());
```

ML-DSA (Dilithium) is a lattice-based digital signature scheme standardized by NIST in 2023. It provides:

### ü¶Ö Falcon - Compact Lattice Signatures

```rust
use pqcrypto_falcon::falcon512::{keypair, sign, verify};
use pqcrypto_traits::sign::{PublicKey, SecretKey, DetachedSignature};
use rand::rngs::OsRng;

// Generate keypair
let (public_key, secret_key) = keypair();

// Message to sign
let message = b"Falcon provides compact signatures with fast verification";

// Sign the message
let signature = sign(message, &secret_key);

// Verify the signature
let verification_result = verify(message, &signature, &public_key);
assert!(verification_result.is_ok());
```

```rust
use pqcrypto_sphincsplus::sphincssha2128fsimple::{keypair, sign, verify};
use pqcrypto_traits::sign::{PublicKey, SecretKey, DetachedSignature};

// Generate keypair
let (public_key, secret_key) = keypair();

// Message to sign
let message = b"SPHINCS+ relies only on the security of cryptographic hash functions";

// Sign message
let signature = sign(message, &secret_key);

// Verify signature
let result = verify(message, &signature, &public_key);
assert!(result.is_ok());
```

SPHINCS+ is a stateless hash-based signature scheme standardized by NIST in 2023:

### üßÆ FrodoKEM - Conservative Lattice KEM

```rust
use pqcrypto_frodokem::frodokem976aes::{keypair, encapsulate, decapsulate};
use pqcrypto_traits::kem::{PublicKey, SecretKey, SharedSecret};

// Generate keypair
let (public_key, secret_key) = keypair();

// Encapsulate to create shared secret and ciphertext
let (shared_secret_sender, ciphertext) = encapsulate(&public_key);

// Decapsulate to recover shared secret
let shared_secret_receiver = decapsulate(&ciphertext, &secret_key);

// Both parties now have the same shared secret
assert_eq!(shared_secret_sender.as_bytes(), shared_secret_receiver.as_bytes());
```

```rust
use pqcrypto_ntru::ntruhrss701::{keypair, encapsulate, decapsulate};
use pqcrypto_traits::kem::{PublicKey, SecretKey, SharedSecret};

// Generate a keypair
let (public_key, secret_key) = keypair();

// Encapsulate a shared secret
let (shared_secret_1, ciphertext) = encapsulate(&public_key);

// Decapsulate the shared secret
let shared_secret_2 = decapsulate(&ciphertext, &secret_key);

// Verify that both sides have the same shared secret
let success = shared_secret_1.as_bytes() == shared_secret_2.as_bytes();
assert!(success);
```
